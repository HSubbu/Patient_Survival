                Survived_1_year == 0, implies that the patient did not survive after 1 year of treatment Survived_1_year == 1, implies that the patient survived after 1 year of treatment

                The features in the dataset are as follows :-

                -ID_Patient_Care_Situation: Care situation of a patient during treatment

                -Diagnosed_Condition: The diagnosed condition of the patient

                -ID_Patient: Patient identifier number

                -Treatment_with_drugs: Class of drugs used during treatment

                -Survived_1_year: If the patient survived after one year (0 means did not survive; 1 means survived)

                -Patient_Age: Age of the patient

                -Patient_Body_Mass_Index: A calculated value based on the patientâ€™s weight, height, etc.

                -Patient_Smoker: If the patient was a smoker or not

                -Patient_Rural_Urban: If the patient stayed in Rural or Urban part of the country

                -Previous_Condition: Condition of the patient before the start of the treatment ( This variable is splitted into 8 columns - A, B, C, D, E, F, Z and Number_of_prev_cond. A, B, C, D, E, F and Z are the previous conditions of the patient. Suppose for one patient, if the entry in column A is 1, it means that the previous condition of the patient was A. If the patient didn't have that condition, it is 0 and same for other conditions. If a patient has previous condition as A and C , columns A and C will have entries as 1 and 1 respectively while the other column B, D, E, F, Z will have entries 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively. The column Number_of_prev_cond will have entry as 2 i.e. 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 in this case. )""")
